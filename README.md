For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

READ the docs/**/*.md files to understand how the app is supposed to work.

Always use the supabase storage functionnality when uploading images, document, etc.. create the corresponding storage and policies if they don't exists.

DO NOT EVER UNDER ANY CIRCONSTANCES USE AN ALERT BOX: ALWAYS USE A PROPER MODAL!

If you create a new storage, ensure it is used with a root folder as the event id with the files within the event folder. Don't forget to add the new storage to the Storage Management tool under Maintenance.
